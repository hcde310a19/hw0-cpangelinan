# Description of your program (part 7)
1. Turn the string into a file
2. Create a variable starting at 0
3. Use object.split method to get rid of unnecessary spacings
4. Use for loop to go through each individual token, adding to the counter after each object encountered

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
I cheated a bit on the last part since I copied my answer from when I took this class last year (before I dropped it...).  Also, I'm not sure if I interpreted this part of the assignment correctly, but oh well.  Without the help from last year, I definitely think I would have struggled on the assignment.  It's difficult for me to think of a solution to something like this because I'm not used to thinking in a way that a computer would understand.

I liked being able to describe the instructions in English since it doesn't involve any of the actual programming yet (something I will definitely struggle with even if the solution is given to me).  I had a lot of trouble with remembering syntax for code in CSE 142.

Over the next few weeks I would love to be able to enhance my critical thinking skills so that I can problem solve programs like the one above on my own.
